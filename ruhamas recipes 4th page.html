            <h4>Measure Ingredients Accurately</h4>
            Use a kitchen scale for precise measurements. This ensures consistent results and avoids common baking mistakes.

            <h4>Room Temperature Ingredients</h4>
            Using room temperature ingredients helps with even mixing and creates a better texture.<br> To quickly bring eggs to room temperature, place them in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes.

            <h4>Don't Overmix
            </h4>
            Overmixing your batter can lead to tough and dense baked goods. Mix just until the ingredients are combined.

        </p>

            <h4>Preheat Your Oven
            </h4>
            Always preheat your oven before baking. An oven that isn't hot enough can cause uneven baking and poor texture.

        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>Use Quality Ingredients

            </h4>
            The quality of your ingredients can greatly impact the flavor and texture of your baked goods. Use the best ingredients you can afford for the best results.
